rubin needs method: save_preconfig *args INT

fix log:   log monitor needs to check file size once a second instead of reading and comparing files.


idea : go into string and create an alias for ssplit




2.11.23   - Adding github file puller/checker to install component, also rubin website latest version checker.  *move to changelog

       - App Controller is now a thing, now that we are demoing multiple apps that interact this component has become semi necessary
- network socket manager & rubin_network manager v 1.1 comming this summer

current bug list:

1. ShowLogWrites config setting doesnt do anything.
2. Controller sometimes crashes when ctrlnetdir isnt set, also there may be some unrescued file writes causing rare errors.
