Fix show logwrites config setting

Added File.view to definitions, fix return info values.


Protocol Style:  checking file sizes is a good way to see when logs change, checking file last modified time
                 can be a better substitute for opening and reading timestamp files. this depends on the host
                 to be reliable.


idea : go into string and create an alias for split
make sure string splice method is added by v1.1 release

Add github raw file puller/checker to install component
also rubin website latest version checker

- network socket manager & rubin_network manager v 1.1 comming this summer

current bug list:

1. ShowLogWrites config setting doesnt do anything.
2. Controller sometimes crashes when ctrlnetdir isnt set, also there may be some unrescued file writes causing rare errors.
