- App Controller is now a thing, now that we are demoing multiple apps that interact this component has become semi necessary


- network socket manager & rubin_network manager v 1.1 comming this summer


current bug list:

1. ShowLogWrites config setting doesnt do anything.
2. Controller sometimes crashes when ctrlnetdir isnt set, also there may be some unrescued file writes causing rare errors.
