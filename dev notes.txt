revist load definition code, i think it just checks for default or takes an array, make it also able to take
a single string but dont mention that in the documentation as to not create confusion.

at some point we need to do a config items reordering, now that we are adding "requires" it needs to go before
any autostart apps or classes so they can pull from it.
also notice "require" and "rubygems" settings run the same call "require 'file'"  they will be right next to
eachother in settings, not sure which order

when calling SYSTEM.config? the config is printed and the return value is supposed to be the boot loaded config
file path but right now it just returns the path of the default config no matter which config actually got loaded.

improve controller binding pool, fix fileio eval settings

???could we tweak the if statement to have an abort or keep and and jump to jump to else call

Added File.view to definitions, fix return info values.

idea : go into string and create an alias for split
make sure string splice method is added by v1.1 release

Add github raw file puller/checker to install component
also rubin website latest version checker

- network socket manager & rubin_network manager v 1.1 comming this summer to replace primitive fileio controler.

current bug list:

1. Controller sometimes crashes when ctrlnetdir isnt set  *** fixed, but,
also there may be some unrescued file writes causing rare errors so i just made the rescue return nil.

2. config settings for fileio are broken since "fileio controler" was converted to "networkdir controller fileio"
